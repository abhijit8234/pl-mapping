ORGANIZATION

At a high-level, this data set contains the reverse DNS records for all
Cogent-owned IPv4 addresses. The records are collected approximately once per
week (see the file "interval-timestamps.csv.txt" in this directory for the
start and end of each collection interval).

The data set is released in three main pieces. The first is the raw output,
given  in the "raw" directory. The second, in the "processed" directory, is a
derivitive data set which has been pre-processed from the raw data set. The
third, in the "iffinder" directory, is the result of running iffinder [1] on
all of the Cogent-owned router interfaces discovered by reverse DNS records.
More details on how iffinder was used can be found in the paper.


COMPRESSION and CHECKSUMS

Each interval in these data sets has been individually compressed using zpaq,
gzip or both. Each zpaq archive is a directory with ~2,500 files (raw) or ~20
files (processed). The SHA1 checksums for each interval are provided in
raw.sha1.txt, processed.sha1.txt, and iffinder.sha1.txt.

Each interval in the raw data set decompresses to ~75 MB worth of gzipped files.
Each interval in the processed data set decompresses to ~15 MB with a mix of
uncompressed text and gzip compressed files. Each interval in the iffinder data 
set decompresses to a single ~3.5 MB text file.


RAW DATA SET FORMAT

Conceptually, the raw data set consists of the output from "host a.b.c.d" using
the Linux host command for all Cogent-owned IP addresses a.b.c.d. Since these
commands were executed in a distributed fashion, each interval of the raw data
set is further divided into a CIDR /19 block (or smaller), yielding around 2,500
files per interval. Each of these blocks is gzip compressed.


PROCESSED DATA SET FORMAT

Each processed interval consists of the following files:

all_alias.txt
    -- all reverse DNS records which are aliases
all_anomaly.txt
    -- anomalous DNS replies (ID mismatch, reply from unexpected source, etc.)
all_exists.txt.gz
    -- results for all reverse DNS records which exist
all_no_ptr.txt
    -- results for all queries which returned "has no PTR record"
cogent-atlas.txt.gz
    -- results for all records in the *.atlas.cogentco.com hierarchy
cogent-demarc.txt
    -- results for all records in the *.demarc.atlas.cogentco.com hierarchy
cogent-dial.txt.gz
    -- results for all records in the *.dial.cogentco.com hierarchy
    -- Note: this file is empty until the 54th interval
COGENT-MASTER-ATLAS.txt
    -- tab-separated file with interface information (grouped by router)
cogent-other.txt
    -- results for all records in the *.cogentco.com hierarchy not in the
       *.atlas.cogentco.com or *.dial.cogentco.com hiearchies.
cogent_pairs_matching_hw.txt
    -- interfaces in the same /30 pair with matching inferred hardware type
cogent_pairs_non-matching_hw-IntegratedServicesModule.txt
    -- interfaces in the same /30 pair where only one is an ISM
cogent_pairs_non-matching_hw-oob.txt
    -- interfaces in the same /30 pair without matching inferred hardware type
       where at least one has "oob" in the reverse DNS record
cogent_pairs_non-matching_hw-others.txt
    -- all interfaces in the same /30 pair without matching inferred type not
       listed in one of the other categories
cogent_pairs_non-matching_hw.txt
    -- all interfaces in the same /30 pair without matching inferred type
cogent_pairs_non-matching_hw-unknown.txt
    -- all interfaces in the same /30 pair where one hardware type is unknown
cogent_pairs_non-matching_hw-vlan.txt
    -- interfaces in the same /30 pair where only one is a VLAN
cogent_pairs.txt
    -- all interfaces in the same /30 pair
pl-errors.txt
    -- error messages on the master produced during the lookups
pl_mapping.sql
    -- dump of the master's status database, which notes the distributed,
       PlanetLab worker which processed each block of IP addresses, the
       time the processing started, and the time it finished
SUMMARY.txt
    -- summary of the raw data set (eg, number of reverse DNS records which
       exist, number of quries which returned NXDOMAIN, etc.)

The files are generated by these scripts ("pl-post-process.sh" is the start):

IFFINDER DATA SET FORMAT

Each interval simply consists of the gzipped output of running iffinder. The
iffinder output includes the time at which it was launched, the time it
finished, the number of probes, and other statistics about the run. The wrapper
used to launch iffinder can be found here:
