Description for the Router Degrees graphs:

Boxplots showing the distribution of router degrees in our dataset over successive weeks.
The boxes cover the second to third quartiles, and the whiskers cover 99\% of the points,
with outliers shown as dots. The thin horizontal line inside the boxes is the median, and
the thicker horizontal line the mean. The distribution is heavily concentrated on smaller
degrees, and remains fairly stable over time.
